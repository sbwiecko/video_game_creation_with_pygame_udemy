# The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame

## From simple games using single images to complex games using classes and 100 sprites, this course will cover it all!

My repository that contains all the course code and assets [Udemy course from Michael Eramo](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-art-of-doing-video-game-creation-with-python-and-pygame/)

- Fundamentals of the Pygame library and overall video game design.
- The use of Classes and Inheritance to make complex code more organized and efficient.
- How to create surfaces, blit images, render text, handle user input, and detect collisions.
- How to work with sprites, sprite groups, and more robust collision methods.
- How to create our own tile map and read a tile map to design a game level.
- How to use 2 dimensional vectors to handle complex platformer motion such as running and jumping under gravity and friction.
- How to add custom character animations using sprite sheets to help make our games really come to life.
- How to use collision masks to have pixel perfect collisions when needed.
- Create 7 awesome games in total! 4 that are very beginner friendly, 2 that are intermediate, and 1 that is advanced.
